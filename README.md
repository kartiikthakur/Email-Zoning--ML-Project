# Email-Zoning-ML

Email  interactions  have  become  an  essentialform  of  communication  in  the  web  today.Companies, schools and regular-business haveadopted  these  exchanges  to  disseminate  in-formation  to  a  wide  broadcast.   Uncoveringthe  main  parts  of  an  email  can  be  used  asa  relevant  source  of  information  to  extractnot  only  the  userâ€™s  profile  but  also  the  writ-ing  trends/patterns  associated.   In  this  paper,it  is  proposed  an  automatic  approach  to  de-tect the general structure of emails by extract-ing  the  greetings,  body  and  signature  zones.In  specific,  a  recurrent  neural  network  en-hance with a set of customized rule-based con-straints  are  employed  for  detecting  the  dif-ferent  email  parts.   The  proposed  method  isapplied  in  a  well  known  email  corpus  (En-ron,  Apache  mailing  list,  etc.)    outperform-ing baseline results related to traditional algo-rithms and hand-crafted rules.  The results ob-tained show that the analysis of word embed-ding sequences and the use of specific word-position  rules  helps  to  accurately  predict  theemail zones of texts lines.
