# Email-Zoning-ML
Email  interactions  have  become  an  essential form  of  communication  in  the  web  today. Companies, schools and regular-business have adopted  these  exchanges  to  disseminate  information  to  a  wide  broadcast.   Uncovering the  main  parts  of  an  email  can  be  used  as a  relevant  source  of  information  to  extract not  only  the  userâ€™s  profile  but  also  the  writing  trends and patterns  associated.   In  this  project, it  is  proposed  an  automatic  approach  to  detect the general structure of emails by extracting  the  greetings,  body  and  signature  zones. In  specific,  a  recurrent  neural  network  enhance with a set of customized rule-based constraints  are  employed  for  detecting  the  different  email  parts. The  proposed  method  is applied  in  a  well  known  email  corpus  (Enron,  Apache  mailing  list,  etc.)    outperforming baseline results related to traditional algorithms and hand-crafted rules.  The results obtained show that the analysis of word embedding sequences and the use of specific word-position  rules  helps  to  accurately  predict  the email zones of texts lines.
